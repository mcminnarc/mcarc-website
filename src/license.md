# Amateur Radio License Testing

Several members of the MCARC are WCARS/VE team members and schedule VE tests **by appointment only**.

## Schedule a Test

**Contact:** Michael Elkins (W1ELK)  
**Phone:** {{ site.phone }}  
**Email:** [w1elkcq@gmail.com](mailto:w1elkcq@gmail.com)

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> VE Testing is NOT a function of the McMinn County Amateur Radio Club. The club receives none of the funds charged for VE testing. All funds go to WCARS.

## What to Bring

1. **FRN Number** — You cannot test without this. See instructions below if you need one.
2. **Valid Photo ID** — Driver's license or passport
3. **Calculator** (optional) — Non-programmable only. Wireless devices with calculators are NOT permitted.
4. **If upgrading:** Bring a COPY (not the original) of your current Amateur Radio license or CSCE

## Testing Fee

**$10.00** (Subject to change — verify when scheduling)

## Tips for Success

- **Come prepared.** Study the material and expect to pass on the first attempt.
- Usually the VEs will allow you to retake a test, but they are not required to do so.
- The VEs are only required to tell you if you passed or failed — they cannot discuss specific questions.
- Test materials are mailed to WCARS no later than the day after the session.

## Getting an FRN Number

The FCC requires all applicants to have an FCC Registration Number (FRN).

**If you're already licensed:** Your FRN is on your license.

**New applicants:**

1. Go to [FCC CORES Registration](https://apps.fcc.gov/coresWeb/publicHome.do)
2. Click "REGISTER"
3. Under "Registration Type" click "An Individual" then "Continue"
4. Follow the instructions and click "SUBMIT"

That's it!
