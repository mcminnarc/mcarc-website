<p>Join us on the air! Our weekly nets are a great way to test your equipment, practice procedures, and stay connected with fellow hams in the area.</p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Net Control Station (NCS)</strong> will open the net at the scheduled time</li>
  <li><strong>Check-ins</strong> are taken in order — just give your callsign when called</li>
  <li><strong>Traffic</strong> is handled after initial check-ins</li>
  <li><strong>Announcements</strong> from the club and members</li>
  <li><strong>Ragchew</strong> time after formal net business</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>New to nets?</strong> Just listen for a few weeks to get familiar with the format, then jump in! Everyone was new once, and our operators are happy to help.
</div>

<h2>Can't Make the Scheduled Time?</h2>

<p>If you're monitoring the repeater and hear the net in progress, you can still check in as a "late check-in" when the NCS asks for them.</p>
