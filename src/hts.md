## Tips for Better Performance

1. **Use a better antenna** — Aftermarket antennas often outperform the stock "rubber duck"
2. **Get higher** — Height helps! Climb a hill or get to an upper floor
3. **Use a speaker mic** — Keeps the radio at a better angle
4. **Carry spare batteries** — Or use an external battery pack
5. **Practice** — Check into our [nets](/nets/) regularly!
