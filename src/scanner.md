## Scanner Crystals

If you have an older crystal-based scanner, search for "scanner crystals" online. They're still available for usually less than $10 each.

## Antenna Tips

While most scanners are sensitive enough for local frequencies, a good outdoor antenna helps a lot!

### Discone Antenna

A popular choice for scanner enthusiasts:
- Mounts on a TV mast
- Lightweight
- Multi-banded (VHF-Lo, VHF-Hi, UHF, 800 MHz)
- Available for less than $100

You'll need RG-58 coax with PL-259 connectors. For handhelds, add an SO-239 to BNC adapter.

### Simple Ground Plane

For VHF-Hi band (135-175 MHz), you can build a simple ground plane antenna from an SO-239 jack and some wire. Even mounted just above your roof peak, you'll receive many more signals.

<strong>Safety First!</strong> Always be careful when installing outdoor antennas. Watch for power lines and be safe on ladders!
